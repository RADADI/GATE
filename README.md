## Environments

- python 3.6
- PyTorch (version: 0.4.0)
- numpy (version: 1.15.0)
- scipy (version: 1.1.0)
- sklearn (version: 0.19.1)


## Dataset

In our experiments, the *citeulike-a* dataset is from http://www.wanghao.in/CDL.htm, the *movielens-20M* dataset is from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/, the *Amazon-CDs* and *Amazon-Books* datasets are from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/.


## Example to run the code

Data preprocessing:

The code for data preprocessing is put in the ```/preprocessing``` folder. ```Amazon_CDs.ipynb``` provides an example on how to transform the raw data into the ```.pickle``` files that used in our program.

Train and evaluate the model (you are strongly recommended to run the program on a machine with GPU):

```
python run.py
```
